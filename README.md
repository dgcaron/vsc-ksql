# KSQL VSCode Syntax Highlighting

This provides language support for [KSQL - the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/).

## How to install

From VSCode, go to Extensions (View->Extensions) and search for `KSQL`. Click on `Install` :) 

You can also download the `vsix` file from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rmoff.ksql) directly to install it locally. 

## How to use it

Any file with the extension `.ksql` will be automagically detected. 

To apply it to any other file, switch the language mode to `KSQL`. You can do this one of two ways: 

1. from the bottom-right of the screen in the status bar, click on the current language name, and change it
2. by going to the command palette (Shift-Cmd-P on the Mac) and entering 'Change Language Mode' (or a subset of it; it will auto-complete), select the match, and then type KSQL. 

The second option is verbose to explain but much faster if you're a keyboard-warrior ðŸ˜Ž

When you install the extension you get a Kafka icon in the activity bar, and you can see the topics, streams and tables in your connected instance. You can refresh the Explorer with Ctrl+Shift+P and choose the `Refresh KSQL Explorer` command.

The extension assumes that your KSQL server is at `localhost:8088`. If it is not change the endpoint URL in the workspace config.

## Get up and start developing straight away

* Open the terminal in the root of the folder and call `npm install`
* Press `F5` to open a new window with this extension loaded.
* open a file with the .ksql extension in the newly openened window.
* Set breakpoints in the code inside `src/KSQLMain.ts` to debug the extension.
* Find output from the extension in the debug console of the initial window.

## TODO

PRs very welcome!
